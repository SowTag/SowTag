### About me

I'm a 20-year-old backend developer and Software Engineering student based in Argentina.

I wrote my first line of code at age 10 while trying to tinker with my family's computer ~~(and not at all absolutely 
destroy its Windows installation)~~, and I haven't stopped since. While my strongest stack is Java with Spring Boot, I'm 
a polyglot at heart. I love diving into low-level systems, optimizing database queries and algorithms, and building 
scalable architecture. I'm an extremely fast learner and can pick up any language or framework in a short amount of time.

My current focus is
* Building robust and reliable APIs (like [Sprank](https://github.com/SowTag/sprank), my banking API).
* Optimizing low-level code (like [DecadeCraft](https://github.com/SowTag/decadecraft), my OpenGL-based Minecraft clone).
* Solving complex problems for large-scale, high-impact systems.

I'm deeply passionate for what I do, and really enjoy listening to the occasional [Casey Muratori](https://www.youtube.com/@MollyRocket)
lecture about performance or [Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)'s excellent math videos.

### Featured Projects

#### [Sprank](https://github.com/SowTag/sprank)
> *A robust, ledger-based banking and payment processing API.*

This is my flagship project demonstrating complex financial domain modeling. Unlike simple CRUD apps, Sprank utilizes a 
**double-entry bookkeeping system** to ensure transaction integrity and auditability, vital for any real-world fintech application.

* **Tech:** Java 21, Spring Boot, MySQL, Docker, Keycloak, Prometheus/Grafana.
* **Key features:** Cash reserves, payment requests (QR payments), multiple currencies, and tax/fee calculation engines.
* **Engineering Quality:** >90% test coverage (120+ tests on >6000 LOC), fully dockerized, and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.


#### [Minimeli](https://github.com/SowTag/minimeli) _(in development)_
> *A microservices-based e-commerce API.*

An exploration into distributed systems and microservice architecture, modeled after high-scale e-commerce platforms.

* **Tech:** Java, Spring Boot, microservices, scalable and resilient patterns.
* **Focus:** Exploring different microservices paradigms like eventual consistency, resilience, polyglot codebases, and distributed tracing.


#### [decadecraft](https://github.com/SowTag/decadecraft) _(in development)_
> *An OpenGL-based Minecraft clone commemorating my 10 years of writing code.*

I wanted to challenge myself to learn manual memory management and 3D graphics. I picked up C++ and OpenGL to build a voxel engine from scratch.

* **Tech:** C++, OpenGL, GLSL.
* **Focus:** Graphics programming, chunk rendering, and performance optimizations.
